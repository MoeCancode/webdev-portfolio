# My-Portfolio

This webpage was created to introduce myself while showcasing my skills & projects to potential clients & employers.

The layout is simple to make navigation easy for all users and has been styled well to give it a clean look. This webpage itself is a project that helps sell me to the people that visit the page.

 The webpage has a responsive design that made use of flexbox and bootstrap classes to ensure that both, mobile & Desktop users, can have a nice experience on the webpage. However, it is recommended to view the webpage on a Desktop screen because of the several 'Hover' features that have been added to it. They make the user experience even more visually pleasing.
